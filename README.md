[![Build Status Master](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/chef/knife-windows?branch=master&svg=true&passingText=master%20-%20Ok&pendingText=master%20-%20Pending&failingText=master%20-%20Failing)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Chef/knife-windows/branch/master)

This plugin adds additional functionality to the Chef Knife CLI tool for
configuring/interacting with nodes running Microsoft Windows. The subcommands
should function on any system running Ruby 1.9.3+ but nodes being configured
via these subcommands require Windows Remote Management (WinRM) 1.0+.WinRM
allows you to call native objects in Windows. This includes, but is not
limited to, running PowerShell scripts, batch scripts, and fetching WMI
variables. For more information on WinRM, please visit
[Microsoft's WinRM site](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384426(v=VS.85).aspx).
You will want to familiarize yourself with (certain key aspects) of WinRM
because you will be writing scripts / running commands with this tool to get
you from specific point A to specific point B.

WinRM is built into Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008+. It can also be easily installed on older version of Windows, including:

* Windows Server 2003
* Windows Vista

More information can be found on [Microsoft Support article 968930](http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=968930).

## Subcommands

This plugin provides the following Knife subcommands. Specific command options can be found by invoking the subcommand with a `--help` flag

### knife winrm

The `winrm` subcommand allows you to invoke commands in parallel on a subset of the nodes in your infrastructure. The `winrm` subcommand uses the same syntax as the [search subcommand](https://docs.chef.io/knife_search.html); you could could find the uptime of all your web servers using the command:

    knife winrm "role:web" "net stats srv" -x Administrator -P 'super_secret_password'

Or force a chef run:

    knife winrm 'ec2-50-xx-xx-124.compute-1.amazonaws.com' 'chef-client -c c:/chef/client.rb' -m -x Administrator -P 'super_secret_password'
    ec2-50-xx-xx-124.compute-1.amazonaws.com [Fri, 04 Mar 2011 22:00:49 +0000] INFO: Starting Chef Run (Version 0.9.12)
    ec2-50-xx-xx-124.compute-1.amazonaws.com [Fri, 04 Mar 2011 22:00:50 +0000] WARN: Node ip-0A502FFB has an empty run list.
    ec2-50-xx-xx-124.compute-1.amazonaws.com [Fri, 04 Mar 2011 22:00:53 +0000] INFO: Chef Run complete in 4.383966 seconds
    ec2-50-xx-xx-124.compute-1.amazonaws.com [Fri, 04 Mar 2011 22:00:53 +0000] INFO: cleaning the checksum cache
    ec2-50-xx-xx-124.compute-1.amazonaws.com [Fri, 04 Mar 2011 22:00:53 +0000] INFO: Running report handlers
    ec2-50-xx-xx-124.compute-1.amazonaws.com [Fri, 04 Mar 2011 22:00:53 +0000] INFO: Report handlers complete

This subcommand operates in a manner similar to [knife ssh](https://docs.chef.io/knife_ssh.html)...just leveraging the WinRM protocol for communication. It also include's `knife ssh`'s "[interactive session mode](https://docs.chef.io/knife_ssh.html#options)"

### knife bootstrap windows winrm

Performs a Chef Bootstrap (via the WinRM protocol) on the target node. The goal of the bootstrap is to get Chef installed on the target system so it can run Chef Client with a Chef Server. The main assumption is a baseline OS installation exists. It is primarily intended for Chef Client systems that talk to a Chef server.

This subcommand operates in a manner similar to [knife bootstrap](https://docs.chef.io/knife_bootstrap.html)...just leveraging the WinRM protocol for communication. An initial run_list for the node can also be passed to the subcommand. Example usage:

    knife bootstrap windows winrm ec2-50-xx-xx-124.compute-1.amazonaws.com -r 'role[webserver],role[production]' -x Administrator -P 'super_secret_password'

### Use SSL for WinRM communication 

By default, the `knife winrm` and `knife bootstrap windows winrm` subcommands use a plaintext transport,
but they support an option `--winrm-transport` (or `-t`) with the argument
`ssl` that allows the SSL to secure the WinRM payload. Here's an example:

    knife winrm -t ssl "role:web" "net stats srv" -x Administrator -P 'super_secret_password'

Use of SSL is strongly recommended, particularly when invoking `knife-windows` on non-Windows platforms, since
without SSL there are limited options for ensuring the privacy of the
plaintext transport. See the section on [Platform authentication
support](#platform-winrm-authentication-support).

SSL will become the default transport in future revisions of
`knife-windows`.

### knife bootstrap windows ssh

Performs a Chef Bootstrap (via the SSH protocol) on the target node. The goal of the bootstrap is to get Chef installed on the target system so it can run Chef Client with a Chef Server. The main assumption is a baseline OS installation exists. It is primarily intended for Chef Client systems that talk to a Chef server.

This subcommand assumes the SSH session will use the Windows native cmd.exe command shell vs a bash shell through an emulated cygwin layer. Most popular Windows based SSHd daemons like [freeSSHd](http://www.freesshd.com/) and [WinSSHD](http://www.bitvise.com/winsshd) behave this way.

An initial run_list for the node can also be passed to the subcommand. Example usage:

    knife bootstrap windows ssh ec2-50-xx-xx-124.compute-1.amazonaws.com -r 'role[webserver],role[production]' -x Administrator -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa

### knife windows cert generate

Generates a certificate(x509) containing a public / private key pair for WinRM 'SSL' communication.
The certificate will be generated in three different formats *.pfx, *.b64 and *.pem.
The PKCS12(i.e *.pfx) contains both the public and private keys, usually used on the server. This will be added to WinRM Server's Certificate Store.
The *.b64 is Base64 PKCS12 key pair. Contains both the public and private keys, for upload to the Cloud REST API. e.g. Azure.
The *.pem is Base64 encoded public certificate only. Required by the client to connect to the server.
This command also displays the thumbprint of the generated certificate.

    knife windows cert generate --cert-passphrase "strong_passphrase" --domain "cloudapp.net" --output-file "~/server_cert.pfx"
    # This command will generate certificates at user's home directory with names server_cert.b64, server_cert.pfx and server_cert.pem.

### knife windows cert install

This command only functions on Windows. It adds the specified certificate to its certificate store. This command must include a valid PKCS12(i.e *.pfx) certificate file path.

    knife windows cert install "~/server_cert.pfx" --cert-passphrase "strong_passphrase"

### knife windows listener create
This command only functions on Windows. It creates the winrm listener for SSL communication(i.e HTTPS).
This command can also install certificate which is specified using --cert-install option and use the installed certificate thumbprint to create winrm listener.
--hostname option is optional. Default value for hostname is *.

    knife windows listener create --cert-passphrase "strong_passphrase" --hostname "*.cloudapp.net" --cert-install "~/server_cert.pfx"

The command also allows you to use existing certificates from local store to create winrm listener. Use --cert-thumbprint option to specify the certificate thumbprint.

    knife windows listener create --cert-passphrase "strong_passphrase" --hostname "*.cloudapp.net" --cert-thumbprint "bf0fef0bb41be40ceb66a3b38813ca489fe99746"

You can get the thumbprint for existing certificates in local store using the following PowerShell command:

    Get-ChildItem -path cert:\LocalMachine\My

## BOOTSTRAP TEMPLATES:

This gem provides the bootstrap template `windows-chef-client-msi`.

### windows-chef-client-msi

This bootstrap template does the following:

* Installs the latest version of Chef (and all dependencies) using the `chef-client` msi.
* Writes the validation.pem per the local knife configuration.
* Writes a default config file for Chef (`C:\chef\client.rb`) using values from the `knife.rb`.
* Creates a JSON attributes file containing the specified run list and run Chef.

This is the default bootstrap template used by both of the `windows bootstrap` subcommands.

## REQUIREMENTS/SETUP:

### Ruby

Ruby 1.9.3+ is needed.

### Chef Version

This knife plugins requires >= Chef 11.0.0. More details about Knife plugins can be
[found in the Chef documentation](https://docs.chef.io/plugin_knife.html).

## Nodes

**NOTE**: Before any WinRM related knife subcommands will function correctly a node's WinRM installation must be configured correctly. The below settings should be added to your base server image (AMI) or passed in using some sort of user-data mechanism provided by your cloud provider.

A server running WinRM must also be configured properly to allow outside connections and the entire network path from the knife workstation to the server. The easiest way to accomplish this is to use [WinRM's quick configuration option](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384372(v=vs.85).aspx#quick_default_configuration):

    winrm quickconfig -q

The Chef and Ohai gem installations (that occur during bootstrap) take more
memory than the default 150MB WinRM allocates per shell on older versions of
Windows (prior to Windows Server 2012) -- this can slow down
bootstrap. Optionally increase the memory limit to 300MB with the following command:

    winrm set winrm/config/winrs @{MaxMemoryPerShellMB="300"}

Bootstrap commands can take longer than the WinRM default 60 seconds to
complete, optionally increase to 30 minutes if bootstrap terminates a command prematurely:

    winrm set winrm/config @{MaxTimeoutms="1800000"}

WinRM supports both the HTTP and HTTPS transports and the following
authentication schemes: Kerberos, Digest, Certificate and Basic. The details
of these authentication transports are outside of the scope of this README but
details can be found on the
[WinRM configuration guide](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384372(v=vs.85).aspx).

## WinRM authentication

The default authentication protocol for `knife-windows` subcommands that use
WinRM is the Negotiate protocol. The following commands when executed on a
Windows system show authentication for domain and local accounts respectively:

    knife bootstrap windows winrm web1.cloudapp.net -r 'server::web' -x 'proddomain\webuser' -P 'super_secret_password'
    knife bootstrap windows winrm db1.cloudapp.net -r 'server::db' -x 'localadmin' -P 'super_secret_password'

The commands above are using the default plaintext transport for WinRM --
the default of Negotiate authentication may not be fully supported on
non-Windows systems using the plaintext transport. To work around this, the
remote system can be configured with an SSL WinRM listener instead of a
plaintext listener. Then the above commands should be modified to use the SSL
transport as follows using the `-t` (or `--winrm-transport`) option with the
`ssl` argument:

    knife bootstrap windows winrm -t ssl web1.cloudapp.net -r 'server::web' -x 'proddomain\webuser' -P 'super_secret_password'
    knife bootstrap windows winrm -t ssl db1.cloudapp.net -r 'server::db' -x 'localadmin' -P 'super_secret_password'

The commands using SSL above will work from any operating system, not just Windows.

### Troubleshooting authentication

For development and testing purposes, unencrypted traffic with Basic
authentication can make it easier to test connectivity. The configuration for
the remote system may be accomplished with the following commands:

    winrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted="true"}
    winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic="true"}

To test connectivity via `knife-windows` from another system, the default
authentication protocol of Negotiate must be overridden using the
`--winrm-authentication-protocol` option with the desired protocol, in this
case Basic:

    knife winrm -m web1.cloudapp.net --winrm-authentication-protocol basic ipconfig -x 'localadmin' -P 'super_secret_password'

Note that when using Basic authentication, domain accounts may not be used for
authentication; an account local to the remote system must be used.

### Platform WinRM authentication support

`knife-windows` supports `Kerberos`, `Negotiate`, and `Basic` authentication
for WinRM communication. However, some of these protocols
may not work with `knife-windows` on non-Windows systems because
`knife-windows` relies on operating system libraries such as GSSAPI to implement
Windows authentication, and some versions of these libraries do not
fully implement the protocols.

The following table shows the authentication protocols that can be used with
`knife-windows` depending on whether the knife workstation is a Windows
system, the transport, and whether or not the target user is a domain user or
local to the target Windows system.

| Workstation OS / Account Scope | SSL                          | Plaintext                  |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Windows / Local                | Kerberos, Negotiate* , Basic | Kerberos, Negotiate, Basic |
| Windows / Domain               | Kerberos, Negotiate          | Kerberos, Negotiate        |
| Non-Windows / Local            | Kerberos, [Negotiate*](https://github.com/chef/knife-windows/issues/176) Basic | Kerberos, Basic |
| Non-Windows / Domain           | Kerberos, Negotiate          | Kerberos                   |

> \* There is a known defect in the `knife winrm` and `knife bootstrap windows
> winrm` subcommands invoked on any OS  platform when authenticating with the Negotiate protocol over
> the SSL transport. The defect is tracked by
> [knife-windows issue #176](https://github.com/chef/knife-windows/issues/176): If the remote system is
> domain-joined, local accounts may not be used to authenticate via Negotiate
> over SSL -- only domain accounts will work. Local accounts will only
> successfully authenticate if the system is not joined to a domain.
>
> This is generally not an issue for bootstrap scenarios, where the
> system has yet to be joined to any domain, but can be a problem for remote
> management cases after the system is domain joined. Workarounds include using
> a domain account instead, or enabling Basic authentication on the remote
> system (unencrypted communication **does not** need to be enabled to make
> Basic authentication function over SSL).

## General troubleshooting

* When I run the winrm command I get: "Error: Invalid use of command line. Type "winrm -?" for help."
  You're running the winrm command from PowerShell and you need to put the key/value pair in single quotes. For example:

   `winrm set winrm/config/winrs '@{MaxMemoryPerShellMB="512"}'`

* Windows 2008R2 and earlier versions require an extra configuration for MaxTimeoutms to avoid WinRM::WinRMHTTPTransportError: Bad HTTP response error while bootstrapping. It should be atleast 300000.

    `winrm set winrm/config @{MaxTimeoutms=300000}`
