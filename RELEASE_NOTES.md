# knife-windows 1.0.0.rc.0 release notes:
This release of knife-windows includes new features to improve authentication,
simplify use of the WinRM SSL transport, and addresses compatibility issues with Chef Client 12.0.

You can install the new features using the `gem` command:

    gem install knife-windows --pre

## Reporting issues and contributing

`knife-windows` issues like those addressed in this release should be reported in the ticketing system at https://github.com/chef/knife-windows/issues. You can learn more about how to contribute features and bug fixes to `knife-windows` in the [Chef Contributions document](http://docs.chef.io/community_contributions.html).

## Breaking changes

### Negotiate as the default authentication protocol
With this release, the default authentication protocol for WinRM
communication is negotiate, which is the same as that for tools built-in to
the Windows operating system. Prior to this release, the protocol depended
on the format of the `--winrm-user` option -- the basic authentication
protocol would be assumed unless that option had the format `domain\user`.

To revert to the behavior of previous releases or otherwise force `knife-windows` to use a specific authentication protocol such as
basic, use the `--winrm-authentication-protocol` option.

### Default WinRM port depends on the transport
The default port for WinRM communication is now **5986** when the SSL transport is used (the transport is
configured by the `winrm_transport` option), otherwise it is **5985**. In
previous releases, if the port was not specified, it was always 5985.

To override this behavior, explicitly specify the desired port using the
`winrm_port` (`-p`) option.

## Features added in knife-windows 1.0.0.rc.0
* New `--winrm-authentication-protocol` option for explicit control of WinRM authentication
* `knife windows cert generate` subcommand:
  Generates a certificate and related public key file for use in configuring a WinRM listener and validating communication involving it.
* `knife windows cert install` subcommand:
  Installs a certificate such as one generated by the `cert generate`
  subcommand into the Windows certificate store's LocalMachine personal store
  so that it can be used as part of the configuration for a WinRM SSL listener
* `knife windows listener create` subcommand:
  Creates a WinRM SSL listener on a Windows system
