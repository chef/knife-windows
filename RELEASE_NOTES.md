* New feature `--winrm-no-encryption` option for explicit control of WinRM encryption

# knife-windows 1.0.0 release notes:
This release of knife-windows includes new features to improve authentication,
simplify use of the WinRM SSL transport, install and download Chef
Client during bootstrap, and addresses compatibility issues with Chef Client 12.0.

You can install the new features using the `gem` command:

    gem install knife-windows

Due to dependency conflicts, to use knife-windows 1.0.0+ with ChefDK
0.6.2, you must also upgrade chef-provisioning to 1.2.0+ and update
the line referencing chef-provisioning in
`c:\opscode\chefdk\bin\chef`. To avoid this, use ChefDk 0.7.0 or later
with this version of `knife-windows`.

    chef gem install knife-windows
    chef gem install chef-provisioning

`knife-windows` issues like those addressed in this release should be reported in the ticketing system at https://github.com/chef/knife-windows/issues. You can learn more about how to contribute features and bug fixes to `knife-windows` in the [Chef Contributions document](http://docs.chef.io/community_contributions.html).

## Breaking changes

### Negotiate as the default authentication protocol
With this release, the default authentication protocol for WinRM
communication is negotiate, which is the same as that for tools built-in to
the Windows operating system. Prior to this release, the protocol depended
on the format of the `--winrm-user` option -- the basic authentication
protocol would be assumed unless that option had the format `domain\user`.

To revert to the behavior of previous releases or otherwise force `knife-windows` to use a specific authentication protocol such as
basic, use the `--winrm-authentication-protocol` option.

### Default WinRM port depends on the transport
The default port for WinRM communication is now **5986** when the SSL transport is used (the transport is
configured by the `winrm_transport` option), otherwise it is **5985**. In
previous releases, if the port was not specified, it was always 5985.

To override this behavior, explicitly specify the desired port using the
`winrm_port` (`-p`) option.

### Kerberos Keytab short option is now -T
The short option flag for --keytab-file is now -T to fix a conflict with the --identity-file option.

## Features added in knife-windows 1.0.0
* New `--winrm-authentication-protocol` option for explicit control of WinRM authentication
* `knife windows cert generate` subcommand:
  Generates a certificate and related public key file for use in configuring a WinRM listener and validating communication involving it.
* `knife windows cert install` subcommand:
  Installs a certificate such as one generated by the `cert generate`
  subcommand into the Windows certificate store's LocalMachine personal store
  so that it can be used as part of the configuration for a WinRM SSL listener
* `knife windows listener create` subcommand:
  Creates a WinRM SSL listener on a Windows system
* Added `--hint` option for creating Ohai hints on bootstrap
* Validatorless bootstrapping is now supported
* New `--bootstrap-install-command` option allows an alternate command
  to be used to install Chef Client
* New `--install-as-service` option will have Chef Client be installed
  as a Windows service on bootstrap
* Added `--msi_url` option for providing an alternate URL to the Chef Client installation package
* `knife wsman test` subcommand:
  Verifies winrm functionality on a remote system, e.g. `knife wsman
  test 192.168.1.10 -m --winrm-transport ssl`
